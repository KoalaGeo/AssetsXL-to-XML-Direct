Script to convert excel asset register to XML for import to GeoNetwork

Anaconda from here:  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

You'll have to change the path to the directory to want to write your content to 

Line 43  write_to = "X:\\md\\kenxml"

and the path/name of the xls file that is your input

Line 53 diart2 = 'X:\md\Data&Info_AssetRegister_Template.xlsx'

The  current expected format of the spreadsheet is two rows of info header, then the row of column names, then two example lines.
